# ML_Project
Prediction models were implemented to classify the red wine quality when knowing a set of its attributes.
Classical machine learning models were implemented, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent and Logistic Regression classifiers. Deep learning models were implemented as well, being currently depicted as the state of the art for classification problems. 
The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comparison of the different models' behaviour when predicting a red wine quality from objective analytical tests that were made available from the proposed dataset and to study its relevance for the application of prediction models within the scientific community.
